To run various notebooks, you will need to add the following data files (from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge/data) manually to the data/ folder:

- members.csv
- song_extra_info.csv
- songs.csv
- train.csv

These data files are not stored in git because of their large size.

Not the artist-scrap notebook will create a new data file:

- artists.csv
