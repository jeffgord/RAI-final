To run the artist-scraper pipeline, make a data/ folder (if not already present) in the root of this repo then, add the following files to this folder:

- songs.csv
- train.csv

Then, if you "run all" cells in the artist-scraper.ipynb (expected runtime about 24 hours), this will create an 'artists.csv' file in the data folder with the scraped information for each artist
